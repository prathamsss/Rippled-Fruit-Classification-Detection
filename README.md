# Rotten-Fruit-Classification-Detection

Project is classifies whether fruit is in  good condition or rotten, 
if it is rotten it identifes the area of rotten portion, showinng percentage of damage.

Frther by using the bounding box, we can use this in ROS as node publishing coordinates of bounding box
which can be used for sorting such fruits using Robotic Arm. This could be acheived by using Denavit Heitenberg principal to reach towards it's position.
